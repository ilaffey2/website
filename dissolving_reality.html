<h1>Dissolving Reality</h1>
<h3>Ian Laffey</h3>
<p>
  I recently found out about Eleatic Philosophy, as described to Plato and
  documented in the book "Reality+".<br />
  This worldview prizes only what can stir or be stirred by change as 'real'.<br />
  <blockquote>
    "I suggest that everything which possesses any power of any kind,<br/>
     either to produce a change in anything of any nature or to be affected
    even in the least degree by the slightest cause,<br/>
    though it be only on one occasion,<br/> has real being"
  </blockquote>

  This
  has left me thinking: What bears more realityâ€”the ever-evolving digital world
  presented on our screens or the seemingly static physical reality enveloping
  us?<br />
</p>
<p>
  We're getting more and more stuck in the digital world<br />
  An expanse constantly reshaping with tweets, status updates, and streaming
  videos.<br />
  This domain, in the Eleatic perspective, qualifies as 'real'. It is always undergoing transitions.<br />
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  Do you even know your neighbor's name?<br/>
  How does a stranger walking down the street impact you?<br/>
  What if your favorite Artist tweeted about your work?<br />
  Does Elon Musk affect your life more than your neighbor?
</p>
<p>
  Let's say there's someone in Indiana or Indonesia, regions with no direct
  contact to my life. <br />I could argue, "I see them on the news. They
  affect me."<br />
  But isn't that interaction facilitated through my screen? It isn't a direct
  interaction, not a handshake, not a shared meal.<br />
  It's their digital echo that incites change.<br />
</p>
<p>
  It almost feels as if we're undergoing a 'death of reality', with the physical
  world becoming 'less real' as it fades into the background.<br/> While we're
  physically present, our minds are hitched more and more to the digital
  world.<br />
</p>
<p>
  This is a strange mix-up. We're lost in the digital world, cut off from the real one, yet oddly, more linked than we've ever been.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Who's in charge of this digital world?<br />
  Those who control the flow of information, the algorithms, the design of the
  digital universe.<br />
  In a way, they are Gods, molding and shaping what is real.<br />
  The content we consume, the people we interact with, the events that sway us,
  are all largely governed by these unseen hands.<br />
</p>
<p>
  It's as if we've breached the fabric of traditional reality, stepping into a
  realm that's mutable, fluid, and in constant flux.<br />
  With every tweet we post, every video we share, every opinion we voice, we
  assert reality.<br />
