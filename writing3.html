        Journalling I did while hiking the Appalachian Trail in 2017. <br>
        I clearly wasn't great with consistency

        Welp. We've done it. 7ish miles into the AT.
        At a nice shelter with a ton of people. Backpacked 50% solo 50%
        with father/son named Doug & Carter. Ate some dinner
        Feeling better physically. Fuck we overpacked though.
        Lots of thru-hilers. Really missing Sadaf and home.
        Wanted to leave, but feeling better now. No point in complaining!
        I think I'm gonna write every day. Sam was pretty
        pokey but he also has SO much food! got about
        13 miles tomorrow double what we did today. Met a guy who 
        looks like charlie from It's Always Sunny. He seems nice enough.
        Kinda weird. He left 3/29 so he's been out a while. Sam just took a shit!
        at least they have a latrine. I wonder If I could write a book. 
        I'm tired as fuck right now though. Think me and sam
        are gonna go play cards. Might read later. Cya!
        I miss Sadaf. A lot.
    </p>

        Posted up at camp store. Phone charging,
        good toilets. Life=nice.
        Not sure where we're sleeping yet.
        Met family man, he seems cool.
        Doug bought me and Sam beer.
        Lmao clutch. Didn't write yesterday.
        But hiked 13 miles. Hiked 7ish today.
        Gonna try to wake up early & see where we can go ma√±ana.
        Phone wouldn't charge on batteries last night,
        but charging on wall now :). Think I need to position cord better.
        Still overpacked, but feeling better on weight & life in general.
        7 miles was a breeze.
        Sadaf, missing you my caramel godess.
        Mom & dad, love you! Sorry for drinking beer but it was free & we're tired.
        Love to all & the world 
        Ian

        Posted up ~200 yds from Pinefield Hut.
        Hut filled with copperheads. Going to put note up & eat here. 
        Lots of people were stopping here, looks like we got 
        to push another 8 :) I wanted to go on anyways so it's ok.
        Hopefully we hit the hut before like 8/8:30. Will probably right [sic] more tonight.
        Feeling even better today. Going much faster. Sam's kinda slow but 
        all is well. Apparently he fucked up his toenail. We will see...

        Sitting in wayside about to bash about 200 calories.
        Goin to start writing college essay. 
        Finally got our trail names. I'm McEnroe like the tennis pro,
        Sam is Goats. Had a nice fire at the shelter last night at the shelter. Met a stoner 
        named Left Eye. He brought 2 ounces of weed all the way from Bama.
        Got in on a bet between "Dad" & "Snowbart" on wheter or not SB could eat 20 hot dogs in 60 minutes.
        I've got 10 bucks riding on it, so it should be pretty intense.
        The food at this restaurant looks good, however it's crawling with more flies than the shits I've been leaving along the AT.
        Not that I care- Goats & I smell like two pissed on hookers. Maybe worse. I've been listening to
        lots of Game of Thrones & music, really grooving. My phone appears to accept 
        charge, at least sporadically. As I started to write this I was almost starving, however as I 
        continue I find I have eaten [???] and am as close as a hiker can be to "full". In 
        terms of food, I have no clue. We probably have about 3/4 days worth of it. We're planning on stopping 
        at Peak Royal. My observation of thru hikers, or all hikers for that matter, is that there are approximately 
        9 babes or black people. All men are white and smell, and all women are 
        either old and sassy or young hippy chicks. Range from brutal, to almost.... ... 
        makes me glad I have a woman back home.

        It has been quite a while since I wrote last.
        Either I've been quite occupied with hiking or talking 
        else I've been otherwise seduced by the sweet call of the internet.
        In any case, here I am, putting pen to paper again, probably for a long while as I am both rather bored 
        and eager to capture and retain my memories of my adventures like a young child with a lightning bug.
        I find memories oft are like lightning bugs, they are both fleeting, beautiful, and at
        this point in my 17 years, have mostly been captured with my dearest mother.
        I have been listening to lots of Game of Thrones as I walk, and one can notice
        how Martin's prose has effected [sic] my own. As for my past 6 [???] days...

        <br>
        I am beginning to develop my hiker legs, and with it an insatiable hiker hunger.
        I have met quite a few interesting characters on the trails one of whom 
        has just plumpt his rump on the bench next to me. Of all the characters 
        conjured before me by the universe in my 12 days and 11 nights, this 
        is probably the most unsatisfactory. A veteran of the armed forces, and a self 
        appointed comic who feels the need to sputter out often about his age and service to the 
        profit engine that is our military. There have been far more njoyable characters I have met, 
        Katniss & bigfoot. I ran back into dad, the possible alcoholic who gave us our trail names. Goats and I took a zero yesterday.
