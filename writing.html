        Nonsensical ramblings or cogent musings? Fine line. No one can read what I write.

        What does one do with an Insubordinant Child?
        <br> Sometimes I think I should've been beaten more.
        Something to FORCE me on the right track. Notion of 
        right + wrong sets in much earlier than any desire to do right.
        I knew I was doing wrong, but there was more feedback from it.
        So maybe beating isn't the answer? too much feedback?
        But when you fuck up adults really tell you what you did.
        No waiting for others, no lessons- just truth & answers.
        Maybe that's why I stopped misbehaving- challenge. I guess 
        initially it may have come in social form. But enough to entertain my mind.
        So no beating.

        What then? Write code? Hated that. Puzzles?
        Fish? Chess was good- but ill behavior takes only a few seconds- no planning necessary.
        What to do with the ill behaved child.

        I guess I have no clue. I turned out alright.
        Swung too hards towards the first challenge I faced.
        Likeability. Jester. Druggard. Self-corrected. No parented.
        Past that now- seeking more challenges. Seeking why I misbehaved - 
        or why I didn't sometimes. Love Chess.

        I'm likeable. I'm liked. I'm loved. I'm accepted.
        No real challenges there- getting corrected is passe.
        Need to push on- do more- still haven't been beaten.

        I've always been a liar. I can convince myself of anything. For years I said I was colourblind, I just wasn't observant.
        <br> To convince yourself you are colourblind is insanity.
         Much of my adolescence. No wonder things went the way they did.

        Hands they smell of fish<br>

        Lit cigarette on an old porch;<br>
        Broken lamp<br>
        Promises unmet;<br>
        Propane tanks yellowed with age;<br>
        ashed cigarrette on an old porch

    <p>
      Machine powered flight has never captivated me 
      beyond its practical applications. But wings? Freedom. Bliss.
      To have them would be to add a whole new dimension for your daily world.
      I have not thought about for quite some time. Imagination died down,
      or was it my goals? Don't need wings if you don't do much. Nowhere to go.
