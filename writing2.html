        I don't really like mine.<br>
        You only get one pair. In a way they are a permanent record
        of everything I've done. The chips from beer bottles & notches from fishing line.
        Let them decay and remember forever. Filled with holes.<br>
        Mine are solid. Not straight, but solid. I love my teeth.

        I find memories often are like lightning bugs, 
        they are both fleeting, beautiful, and at 
        this point in my 17 years, have mostly been captured 
        with my mother.

        Please don't break me.<br>
        Don't rape me. My heart is fragile.<br>
