      <p>Created a C Compiler, in Java from scratch. This included lexer, parser, AST generator, semantic analyzer, and
        regalloc. This was an individual project. Some boilerplate code by Christophe Dubach.</p>
      <p>Sadly, as this is for a <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs520/2021/index.html">class at McGill</a>, and the
        course content is static, it is not open source.</p>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        A compiler is actually just a massive collection of very straightforward things.
        There weren't too many crazy algorithms or bits of Java syntax required.
      </p>

      <p>
        Writing such a large scale program myself gave me practice with abstracting and focusing on different parts of a
        program at a time, and learning where to look when debugging. In contrast to a larger, group project where it's
        probably someone else's fault if something was broken outside of the section I'm currently working in, here I
        had
        to switch gears if I discovered a bug in something previously written.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since register allocation is really just graph building and coloring, I got lots of hands-on experience with
        graph related algorithms. It was also nice to apply theoretical syntax, semantic, and typing rules I've
        encountered
        in other classes (although they can be much trickier than they are here).
      </p>

      <p>
        This project was a big confidence builder in my coding abilities.<br>
        Obviously, I learned a lot about how Compilers function behind the scenes.<br>
        Surprisingly, I did not learn anything new about C, since I was not actually writing the compiler in C.
      </p>

      <h2>What's Going On</h2>
      <h3>Lexer</h3>
      <p>
        By far the most simple part of the compiler, the Lexer generates tokens from input text.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Tokenizer was basically a long switch statement with checks: whitespace had to be ignored, and comment
        strings recognized.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Token object contains additional information, like position and character type
        (char, int).
      </p>

      <p>
        A simple Scanner was created, feeding data into the Tokenizer, which then created Token objects.
      </p>


      <h3>Parser</h3>
      <p>Verify the syntax of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">EBNF
          Grammar</a> representing a subset of C - "Mini C"</p>

      The following analysis was done on the AST:

      Name Analysis: Ensure that the scoping and visibility rules of the language are respected.<br />
      Global and Local Scopes: Identifiers declared in the global scope can be accessed anywhere in the program, A
      variable declared in a block is accessible in the block and all inner blocks of that block, but not accessible
      outside the block. In both cases, it is illegal to declare twice the same identifiers in the same current block.
      <br />
      Shadowing: An identifier declared within a given scope has the same name as an identifier declared in an outer
      scope.
      <br />
      Built-in functions: void print_s(char* s); void print_i(int i); void print_c(char c); char read_c(); int read_i();
      void* mcmalloc(int size);
      <br />
      Type Analysis: Using formal typing rules for Mini C to perform static type-checking.
      <br />
      L-value checking: lvalues (left-values) are the only expressions that can appear on the left-hand side of an
      assignment or as an argument to the address-of operator (&).
      <br />
      <h3>Code Generation</h3>
      <p>
        After verifying the semantics, code needs to be generated to execute the program.
        The program is compiled into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture">MIPS</a> in order to use
        <a href="https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/">MARS</a>, a cross platform MIPS simulator used for
        educational purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will now produce temporary MIPS code, using virtual registers.
        Virtual registers are representations of real registers, but there is no limit to how many can be used.
        They can be naively interacted with by saving/loading their contents onto the stack every time they are used,
        however this is very slow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Global variables are statically stored in memory using the MIPS <span class="red">.data</span> directive.<br>
        Local variables are stored in memory on the stack, using <span class="red">$sp</span> manipulation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Data padding is an important consideration, as
        <span class="green">sizeof(char) == 1</span>,
        <span class="green">sizeof(int) == 4</span>,
        <span class="green">sizeof(int*) == 4</span>,
        but all fields must align at a 4 byte (32-bit) boundary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Branching is done by converting conditionals into a combination of
        <span class="blue">j</span>, <span class="blue">b</span>, and <span class="blue">bne</span> instructions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Struct/Array access and assignment is done using
        <span class="blue">lw</span> and <span class="blue">sw</span> instructions and considering an offset.
      </p>

      <p>
        Function calls are done using a <span class="blue">j label</span> instruction, and pushing
        <span class="red">$s</span> and <span class="red">$rp</span> onto the stack so they are not overwritten.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stdlib functions are performed using MIPS <span class="red">syscall</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Local, static variables (that never have an & operation called on them),
        are represented as virtual registers to allow them to be optimized in register allocation.
        Only the variables that need to be in memory are ever in memory, the ones that can be handled through registers
        are, and the stack is avoided when possible.
      </p>

      <h4>Register Allocation</h4>
      <p>
        Now that we have a complete MIPS program using virtual registers, we need to allocate real registers to our
        program.
        MIPS provides 18 variable registers <span class="red">$s0–s9</span>, <span class="red">$t0–t7</span>,
        where s-registers are guaranteed to be saved after a function call.
        MIPS also includes system registers <span class="red">$sp</span>, <span class="red">$ip</span>,
        <span class="red">$mul</span>, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to keep track of what is being executed when, a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph">Control-Flow Graph (CFG)</a> is created.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2004/spring/22620-1/docs/liveness.pdf">Liveness
          Analysis</a>
        is performed on the CFG, with each node of the CFG keeping a liveIn and liveOut set.
        This information is then used to create an Interference Graph, where edges represent a point in the program
        execution where both virtual registers are alive at the same time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that the CFG nodes are <em>instructions</em>, the Interference Graph nodes are <em>virtual registers</em>.
        Big difference!
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally I implemented
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_algorithm">Chaitin's Algorithm for Graph Colouring</a>,
        which includes a spill function, where if we were unable to properly colour the interference graph,
        spill is saved onto the stack.
