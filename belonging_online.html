            <p>
                I wrote an Essay entitled "This is Where I Belong" about a place I could never visit again.<br>
                I guess that's the thing about belonging. You can't understand you were "in" until you are "out".<br>
                The whole time you exist in a place, you see yourself as outside that place. Only when you have left can
                you properly position yourself within the space.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the internet, everyone belongs. If you don't you will be quickly made to. Don't get added to group
                chats? Join a subreddit.<br>
                The borders are fixed online. No waiting on pesky experience to know your place, it's a boolean switch.
                <span class="emphasis">"Joined"</span><br>
                Sites are crafted from discrete blocks. In the header? Out of the div?
            </p>

            <p>
                So while the internet creates division, it does so by distributing belonging. Tribalism is as old as
                humanity, and now it's apparent where we do and do not belong.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sports. I know I am a Cardinals fan. I'm from St. Louis. I hate the Cubs. I belong at a Cardinals
                game.<br>
                Basketball? Where do I belong?<br>
                Luckily this has been solved for in a profitable way: Pick a team. Bet. Now you are "in" for the next 4
                hours.<br>
                Discrete. Solvable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Have humans always been this easy?<br>
                Dangle two boxes and watch them pay you to join one?<br>
                Dr. Seuss wrote about this in "The Sneetches"

                I think there used to be more assuredness in our birth.<br>
                I know I am a Cardinals fan, a McGill Alumnus, and an American.<br>
                I'd be hard pressed to double that list, and one of those I had to earn my place in!<br>
                I was not born into a family farm, a town church, or with an undying duty to King and Country.<br>
                I didn't even go to public school!
            </p>

            <p>
                Race, class, religion.<br>
                Belonging once offered through social structure, broken down in pursuit of progress.
            </p>

            <p>
                Slavery is the greatest evil committed in the history of The United States.<br>
                Then why did it last? Profit?<br>
                A relatively small number of Southerners owned slaves, and most who did didn't make any money off of
                them.<br>
                So no, not money. Not for most people.<br>

                As we set about tearing down these oppressive structures of control, what did we replace them with?<br>
                Nothing. Nothing but suburbs.<br>
                And so we atomized the American life. Spread out, settled down, content that we were no longer hurting
                others.<br>
                But in this void we left nothing. If I'm not white then what am I?
            </p>

            <p>
                Like all efficient systems, capitalism has a way of filling in gaps in output.<br>
                For this system there is a single goal: More profit for those with capital.<br>
                And so it set about creating belonging to sell once more: Bowling leagues sprung up, PTA, anything to
                make us feel a part of something.<br>
                But this belonging of choice proved laughable compared to the belonging of birth provided by our old
                oppressive systems.<br>
                See "Fight Club", my singular reference for the world before my birth, as a display of society in search
                of meaning.<br>
                (I was born the day after it released, so it has got me covered on what was going on up until my
                existence)
            </p>

            <p>
                In 1999 our economic system was still searching for the new Racism. the new Religion, the new
                fundamental delineator of humanity.

                Our money machine pounced. First step: get everyone online.<br>
                Once we plopped down the cables, discounted the screens, and lured them into place we could begin to
                divide them up like early settlers.<br>
                "Go West!"<br>
                50 years later: "You're in Utah!"
            </p>

            <p>
                The trap was set. We came pouring in.<br>
                At first in search of utility:<br>
                Web Games, Photo Filters.<br>
                Then in search of meaning:<br>
                Why don't I understand a single fucking thing?<br>
                Why do I feel so lonely but hate people?<br>
                Perfect timing.

                Belonging was bestowed upon us once more.<br>
                Not that crappy sort of, "I can move and this all goes away" bowling league Belonging of Choice.<br>
                This is the "Cardinals Baseball" Belonging of Birth.<br>
                <span class="emphasis">Belonging of Algorithm.</span><br>
                No free will required.<br>
                What is belonging if not a lack of choices? A puzzle piece cannot choose where it fits.<br>
                The very definition of belonging.

            <p>
                It is in the careful crafting of our tribes that the money is to be made.<br>
                "I don't care where you go, just get in your box and suck on a straw"<br>
                This is what Mark Zuckerberg is thinking. But he tells you:<br>
                "I found your people! You won't find a place you fit in more in the world"<br>
                And he's right.

                It is in the hijacking of our fundamental human desire to belong that these systems fuck us the
                most.<br>
                But who are we to fight back? With what army? Where else do we turn?<br>
                Our institutions have been ripped apart and replaced by money machines.
            </p>

            <p>
                Remote worker commune? Government legislation? Federally assigned meaning to life at birth?<br>
                I don't know the solution.<br>
                I think the real answer is it comes from within.
            </p>

            <p>
                A good friend of mine loves to describe technology as "Insidious" and no more frequently is that
                apparent than in the creation of ideas.<br>
                Bombarded by thoughts that are not our own, in our little black box of belonging, we can sit all day
                without thinking.<br>
                We may feel a great amount, but all the thoughts in our head are external.<br>
                We cannot know what we truly want unless we think for ourselves. It's in the name.
            </p>

            <p>
                While the boxes we are assigned may present a close approximation of our thoughts and beliefs, there is
                still divergence (Give 'em 5 years).<br>
                It is in that gap that we exist as humans.<br>
                It is in the intersection with others that we live.<br>
                It is our position in the spaces we inhabit that we exist.<br>
                <span class="emphasis">To know oneself is to know ones place, and that is where we belong.</span>
