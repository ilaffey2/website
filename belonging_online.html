<h1>Belonging Online</h1>
<h3>Ian Laffey</h3>

I wrote an Essay entitled &quot;This is Where I Belong&quot; about a place I could never visit again.<br>
I guess that&#39;s the thing about belonging. You can&#39;t understand you were &quot;in&quot; until you are &quot;out&quot;. <br>
The whole time you exist in a place, you see yourself as outside that place. Only when you have left can you properly position yourself within the space.<br>
</p>
<p>
On the internet, everyone belongs. If you don&#39;t you will be quickly made to. Don&#39;t get added to group chats? Join a subreddit.<br>
The borders are fixed online. No waiting on pesky experience to know your place, it&#39;s a boolean switch. &quot;Joined&quot;<br>
Sites are crafted from discrete blocks. In the header? Out of the div?<br>
</p>
<p>
So while the internet creates division, it does so by distributing belonging. Tribalism is as old as humanity, and now it's apparent where we do and do not belong.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sports. I know I am a Cardinals fan. I&#39;m from St. Louis. I hate the Cubs. I belong at a Cardinals game.<br>
Basketball? Where do I belong?<br>
Luckily this has been solved for in a profitable way: Pick a team. Bet. Now you are &quot;in&quot; for the next 4 hours.<br>
Discrete. Solvable.<br>
</p>
<p>
Have humans always been this easy?<br>
Dangle two boxes and watch them pay you to join one?<br>
Dr. Seuss wrote about this in &quot;The Sneetches&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>
I think there used to be more assuredness in our birth. <br>
I know I am a Cardinals fan, a McGill Alumnus, and an American.<br>
I&#39;d be hard pressed to double that list, and one of those I had to earn my place in!<br>
I was not born into a family farm, a town church, or with an undying duty to King and Country. <br>
I didn&#39;t even go to public school!<br>
</p>
<p>
Race, class, religion.<br>
Belonging once offered through social structure, broken down in pursuit of progress.<br>
</p>
<p>
Slavery is the greatest evil committed in the history of The United States.<br>
Then why did it last? Profit?<br>
A relatively small number of Southerners owned slaves, and most who did didn&#39;t make any money off of them.<br>
So no, not money. Not for most people.<br>
Belonging.<br>

&quot;If you can convince the lowest white man he&#39;s better than the best colored man, he won&#39;t notice you&#39;re picking his pockets&quot;<br>
-Lyndon B Johnson.<br>
</p>
<p>
A genius system then for those who do the pocket picking.<br>
Give belonging, take rights.<br>
Give belonging, make money.<br>
</p>
<p>
As we set about tearing down these oppressive structures of control, what did we replace them with?<br>
Nothing. Nothing but suburbs.<br>
And so we atomized the American life. Spread out, settled down, content that we were no longer hurting others.<br>
But in this void we left nothing. If I&#39;m not white then what am I?<br>
</p>
<p>
Like all efficient systems, capitalism has a way of filling in gaps in output.<br>
For this system there is a single goal: More profit for those with capital.<br>
And so it set about creating belonging to sell once more: Bowling leagues sprung up, PTA, anything to make us feel a part of something.<br>
But this belonging of choice proved laughable compared to the belonging of birth provided by our old oppressive systems.<br>
See &quot;Fight Club&quot;, my singular reference for the world before my birth, as a display of society in search of meaning. <br>
(I was born the day after it released, so it has got me covered on what was going on up until my existence)<br>
</p>
<p>
In 1999 our economic system was still searching for the new Racism. the new Religion, the new fundamental delineator of humanity.<br>
</p>
<p>
Enter internet.<br>
Its creators dreamed of a world without borders, free exchange of ideas. Nerds.<br>
</p>
<p>
Our money machine pounced. First step: get everyone online.<br>
Once we plopped down the cables, discounted the screens, and lured them into place we could begin to divide them up like early settlers.<br>
&quot;Go West!&quot;<br>
50 years later: &quot;You&#39;re in Utah!&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>
The trap was set. We came pouring in.<br>
At first in search of utility: <br>
Web Games, Photo Filters.<br>
Then in search of meaning: <br>
Why don&#39;t I understand a single fucking thing? <br>
Why do I feel so lonely but hate people?<br>
Perfect timing. <br>
</p>
<p>
Belonging was bestowed upon us once more.<br>
Not that crappy sort of, &quot;I can move and this all goes&quot; away bowling league Belonging of Choice.<br>
This is the &quot;Cardinals Baseball&quot; Belonging of Birth.<br>
Belonging of Algorithm. <br>
No free will required.<br>
What is belonging if not a lack of choices? A puzzle piece cannot choose where it fits.<br>
The very definition of belonging.<br>
</p>
<p>
It is in the careful crafting of our tribes that the money is to be made.<br>
&quot;I don&#39;t care where you go, just get in your box and suck on a straw&quot;<br>
This is what Mark Zuckerberg is thinking. But he tells you:<br>
&quot;I found your people! You won&#39;t find a place you fit in more in the world&quot;<br>
And he&#39;s right.<br>
</p>
<p>
It is in the hijacking of our fundamental human desire to belong that these systems fuck us the most.<br>
But who are we to fight back? With what army? Where else do we turn?<br>
Our institutions have been ripped apart and replaced by money machines.<br>
</p>
<p>
Remote worker commune? Government legislation? Federally assigned meaning to life at birth?<br>
I don&#39;t know the solution.<br>
I think the real answer is it comes from within.<br>
</p>
<p>
A good friend of mine loves to describe technology as &quot;Insidious&quot; and no more frequently is that apparent than in the creation of ideas.<br>
Bombarded by thoughts that are not our own, in our little black box of belonging, we can sit all day without thinking.<br>
We may feel a great amount, but all the thoughts in our head are external.<br>
We cannot know what we truly want unless we think for ourselves. It&#39;s in the name.<br>
</p>
<p>
While the boxes we are assigned may present a close approximation of our thoughts and beliefs, there is still divergence (Give &#39;em 5 years).<br>
It is in that gap that we exist as humans.<br>
It is in the intersection with others that we live.<br>
It is our position in the spaces we inhabit that we exist.<br>
To know oneself is to know ones place, and that is where we belong.<br>
